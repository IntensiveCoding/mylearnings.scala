/**
 * A class is a blueprint for objects
 * 
 * Objects can be created from the class with the
 * keyword 'new'
 *  
 * Fields hold the state or data of an object
 * Methods use that data to do the computational work.
 * 
 * At the time of instantiating a class, some memory space will
 * get allotted to hold the image of that object's state i.e., the
 * contents of its variables.
 * 
 * Class Name - Unlike Java, the file name and class name can be different.
